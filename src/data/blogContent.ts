    <p class="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
      In B2B SaaS, your product roadmap is more than a list of features — it's the strategic narrative of where your company is going and why.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      But in today's environment, that narrative is under pressure like never before. Budgets are tightening, investors are pushing for aggressive growth, and the rapid rise of AI is reshaping entire markets. Meanwhile, your GTM (go-to-market) teams are surfacing new opportunities that feel "too important to ignore" if you want to hit this quarter's number.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      As a product leader, you find yourself caught between two powerful forces: the short-term revenue targets that keep the business alive, and the long-term product vision that keeps it meaningful. Balancing these competing priorities — without losing your team's focus or your product's identity — is one of the hardest challenges in B2B SaaS today.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">So how do you build a product roadmap that serves both the now and the next?</h2>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Product Roadmap Paradox</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Every product leader eventually faces a version of this question:
    </p>

    <p class="italic mb-4">
      "We've got a big customer who says they'll sign if we just build this one feature…"
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      You know that story. Your sales team sees a clear path to closing a deal. Your customer success team sees retention risk. And your leadership team sees numbers that must move. But you also know that chasing one-off requests can quickly turn your elegant product vision into a patchwork of custom work.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      This tension — between short-term revenue and long-term vision — is not a flaw in your strategy; it's a structural feature of building in B2B SaaS. The key is not to eliminate it, but to manage it with clarity, transparency, and discipline.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Why It's Harder Than Ever</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      The current market reality makes this balancing act even more complex:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
      <li>Growth expectations remain high, but capital is tighter.</li>
      <li>AI has shifted customer expectations, demanding faster innovation cycles.</li>
      <li>The market itself is contracting in many SaaS verticals.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8">
      In this environment, it's easy to become reactive — to build for whoever shouts loudest. But the companies that will emerge stronger are those who can navigate the noise by staying anchored in a clear mission and vision.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Anchor Everything in Your Product Vision</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Your product vision is not a slide for board meetings — it's your decision-making compass.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      When you have a clearly articulated vision and mission, it becomes much easier to say "no" or "not now" without losing trust. Your teams know why certain initiatives matter more. Your GTM partners can connect customer needs back to the company's broader direction. And your customers see consistency in your product evolution.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      A strong vision doesn't limit flexibility; it gives it purpose.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Four Practices to Navigate the Now vs. Next Challenge</h2>

    <p class="mb-8">
      These are 4, of many good practices I've seen from great leaders but also from my experience in these situations. There for sure will be more to add and I'm happy to hear what works for you, but these 4 practices should help you set the standards of how you work as a Product leader in this challenging environment.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">1. Talk Regularly to Your Customers — to Hear What They Say (and What They Don't)</h3>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Customer conversations are your most powerful roadmap input — but only if you listen beyond their words.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      What customers say they want usually reflects their immediate pain points. What you should build for the long term often lies between the lines: the underlying workflows, unmet needs, or inefficiencies they haven't articulated yet.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Regular customer engagement — through interviews, usage reviews, and feedback loops — allows you to see both horizons. It helps you identify which short-term opportunities ladder up to your long-term vision, and which ones are just distractions in disguise.
    </p>

    <p class="font-semibold mb-8">
      Don't just validate features. Validate direction.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">2. Use a Clear, Quantitative Prioritization Framework — and Make GTM Part of It</h3>

    <p class="mb-6">
      When priorities feel subjective, every "urgent" deal becomes a debate. The solution: create a transparent prioritization framework that everyone — including GTM — understands and contributes to.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      It can be RICE, Value vs. Effort, ROI or a custom scoring model. The important thing is that it's quantitative, repeatable, and co-owned by cross-functional teams.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      <em>Want to dive deeper into choosing and implementing the right framework? Check out my detailed guide: <a href="https://cristiantumani.com/blog/prioritization-frameworks-that-actually-work" class="text-primary hover:underline font-medium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prioritization Frameworks That Actually Work</a>.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      When new opportunities come in, GTM leaders should already know the trade-offs — that adding one initiative means something else must drop. This shared language of prioritization removes emotion from the process and builds alignment across teams.
    </p>

    <p class="font-semibold mb-8">
      A great framework doesn't remove tough choices. It makes them visible.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">3. Communicate the Long-Term Vision and the "Why" Behind It</h3>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Your teams — and even your customers — need to understand not just what you're building, but why.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Regularly communicate your long-term product narrative:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>What problem are you ultimately solving?</li>
      <li>What does success look like in 2–3 years?</li>
      <li>Why is it critical to invest in this now?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      When people understand the "why," short-term sacrifices make sense. Your GTM team can better position your roadmap decisions to customers. Your engineers stay motivated through the tough trade-offs. And leadership discussions shift from "Why aren't we building this?" to "How does this fit with our mission?"
    </p>

    <p class="font-semibold mb-8">
      Vision creates alignment. Communication sustains it.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">4. Time-Box Short-Term Initiatives to Limit Trade-Off Cost</h3>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Sometimes, you do need to chase short-term revenue — and that's okay. But treat these as controlled experiments, not open-ended commitments.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Time-box them aggressively: set clear development boundaries, define a maximum effort (e.g., 2–4 weeks), and be explicit about what "done" looks like.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      This approach reduces opportunity cost and prevents months of deviation from your core roadmap. It also keeps your team flexible enough to respond to future, potentially more strategic opportunities that may emerge in parallel.
    </p>

    <p class="font-semibold mb-8">
      Every short-term project should have an expiry date — otherwise, it becomes your roadmap.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Bringing It All Together</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Balancing short-term revenue opportunities and long-term product vision isn't a one-time decision — it's an ongoing discipline.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      You'll never have perfect alignment, and that's okay. The goal isn't to eliminate tension but to manage it intentionally. That means:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
      <li>Staying close to your customers (for both what they say and what they mean).</li>
      <li>Building transparent frameworks so everyone understands trade-offs.</li>
      <li>Constantly reinforcing the vision so your teams don't lose sight of the "why."</li>
      <li>Containing short-term work so it doesn't consume your roadmap.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text-lg font-medium mt-12">
      In uncertain markets, clarity of purpose is your greatest advantage. The companies that can keep both the short-term engine running and the long-term vision alive will be the ones still standing — and thriving — when the next wave of disruption comes.

    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      In 2019, I packed my bags in Chile and moved to Amsterdam to join adidas — truly a dream come true.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      People often ask me about my decision-making process, but honestly, there wasn't much hesitation. The opportunity to live an international experience with my family, in an incredible country like The Netherlands, and working for one of the most iconic brands in the world… it was hard to say no.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Don't get me wrong — it wasn't an easy decision. But once we did the classic pros and cons list, it became clear that it was the right move.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Five amazing years later — the birth of two of my three kids, a pandemic, a career change, and countless new friends and connections — we faced another big decision. This time, not to go back to Chile, but to move again, to Barcelona. Another fantastic city, but a completely different lifestyle from what we were used to in Amsterdam.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Through these experiences, I've learned a lot about what it means to start fresh in a new country. If you're considering taking a similar leap, here are a few pieces of advice that might help you on your journey.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">Be on the Same Boat with Your Partner</h2>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
      I can't stress this enough — this is not just your experience, it's your family's. Everyone needs to be truly on board. Talk about the opportunities and the risks. Discuss all possible scenarios — what happens if things don't go as planned? What's your action plan? What are your options? The stronger your alignment as a family, the smoother the transition will be.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">Do Your Research</h2>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Find people who already live (or have lived) in the country you're moving to. And if possible, talk to more than one. Ask them everything:
    </p>
    
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 ml-4">
      <li>Work-life balance</li>
      <li>Cost of living</li>
      <li>Social connections</li>
      <li>Weather</li>
      <li>Bureaucracy</li>
    </ul>

      As expats, we've all been there — and we're usually happy to help others going through the same process.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">Don't Overthink It</h2>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This might sound contradictory after the previous point, but once you've done your research, don't overthink it.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Overanalyzing tends to make us focus on what could go wrong, and staying in your comfort zone will always feel safer. But trust me — even if things don't go exactly as expected, you'll never regret taking this step. It's one of those life-changing experiences that shape who you are, both personally and professionally.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">Arrive Early and Explore</h2>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      If you're moving for work, try to arrive a few weeks before starting your new job. Use that time to explore your new city — walk around, visit parks and museums, join free walking tours, and learn how locals live.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
      This will help you feel more connected to your surroundings and make the transition much smoother once your daily routine begins.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">Embrace the Rollercoaster</h2>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Moving abroad comes in phases. At first, it's like a honeymoon — everything feels new, exciting, and full of possibilities. Then comes the comparison phase — when you start noticing what you miss from "back home" and what's harder in your new environment. But eventually, you'll reach acceptance and integration, when your new city starts feeling like home.
    </p>
    
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For most people, this rollercoaster takes about a year. And when you finally reach that point, you'll look back and realize how much you've grown.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      If you're considering an international move — or specifically heading to Amsterdam or Barcelona — feel free to reach out. I'm always happy to share more tips and personal experiences to help you navigate this exciting chapter.

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Becoming an expat is not just about changing countries — it's about changing perspectives. It challenges you, humbles you, and rewards you in ways you can't imagine until you live it.

      Take the leap. You might just find a new version of yourself waiting on the other side.

      If you've worked in Product for more than five minutes, you've probably seen it: Everyone agrees prioritization is important… and absolutely no one agrees on how to do it.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Across my years in companies of all shapes and sizes—from big B2C brands like LATAM Airlines and adidas to fast-moving B2B SaaS teams—this question keeps coming back:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>How do Product teams prioritize?</li>
      <li>How do we choose what to build next when everyone wants something?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4">
      And trust me, everyone always wants something:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>CSMs</strong> want to reduce churn and expand accounts → "We just need this improvement…"</li>
      <li><strong>Sales</strong> wants new shiny features to win deals → "We just need this additional functionality to close this deal…"</li>
      <li><strong>Product</strong> wants to build toward the long-term vision → "We just need to not derail the roadmap…"</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      So how do you turn all these conflicting needs into a clear plan without losing your mind?
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      <em>This challenge sits at the heart of product roadmapping. If you're wrestling with balancing short-term revenue needs against long-term vision, check out my companion piece: <a href="https://cristiantumani.com/blog/balancing-now-and-next-product-roadmap" class="text-primary hover:underline font-medium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balancing the Now and the Next: Building a Product Roadmap That Serves Both Revenue and Vision</a>.</em>
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Let me break down what I've learned—after lots of prioritization sessions, debates, and the occasional "Why isn't this on the roadmap?!" Slack message.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">1. Don't Over-Engineer Your Prioritization Framework</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      This is the biggest trap PMs fall into—especially when trying to "prove" they're being rigorous.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      We build complex spreadsheets… with 18 dimensions… weighted according to the moon cycle and the Fibonacci sequence…
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      And then two things happen:
    </p>

    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>You waste a ton of time collecting data instead of building.</li>
      <li>You're suddenly doing analytics gymnastics instead of making product decisions.</li>
      <li>No one understands your model.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="mb-6">
      If people don't get the framework, they question the output. You get stuck explaining formulas instead of explaining priorities.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 font-medium">
      Keep it simple enough that people understand it without a PhD (in other words, you could explain it to your beautiful and caring Grandmom and she will understand it).
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">2. Communicate Your Framework Like It's a Product Feature</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      This is honestly more important than the framework itself.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Most stakeholder complaints aren't about what you prioritized. They're about feeling out of the loop.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2">
      When people understand:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>what the roadmap is</li>
      <li>why things are prioritized</li>
      <li>how decisions are made</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      …they're far more accepting, even if their request isn't scheduled.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 font-bold">
      Transparency > Perfection.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">3. Execution Beats Perfect Prioritization Every Single Time</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      You will never prioritize flawlessly. You will ship things that flop. Everyone does.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      But that's fine.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The real danger is spending months planning, debating, analyzing… and then executing slowly or poorly.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6 font-medium">
      A decent idea shipped fast teaches you more than a "perfect" plan stuck in analysis paralysis.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">4. Prioritization Frameworks Won't Tell You ARR (and They Shouldn't)</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      I've seen so many teams try to force frameworks to spit out an ARR number.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      It doesn't work.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Really, it doesn't.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Prioritization models are designed to compare initiatives relative to one another, not calculate revenue. Trying to turn them into forecasting tools will only mislead conversations and expectations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">So, What Prioritization Frameworks Actually Work?</h2>

    <p class="mb-8">
      After trying countless models, I consistently rely on two.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Framework #1: The Effort vs Impact Matrix</h3>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Simple, visual, and perfect as a starting point.
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Impact</strong> → What value does it unlock?</li>
      <li><strong>Effort</strong> → How hard is it to deliver (including risks & dependencies)?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-2">
      It quickly highlights:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>quick wins</li>
      <li>big bets</li>
      <li>things to ignore</li>
      <li>things to postpone</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Great for alignment. Great for speed. But yes—it's not the most nuanced.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">Framework #2: RICE (or ICE if you want it simpler)</h3>

    <p class="mb-6">
      This is my go-to when you need more precision without over-engineering.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-2 font-medium">
      RICE stands for:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>R</strong> — Reach: How many users/customers will be impacted?</li>
      <li><strong>I</strong> — Impact: How significant is the value or improvement?</li>
      <li><strong>C</strong> — Confidence: How sure are we about the assumptions?</li>
      <li><strong>E</strong> — Effort: What's the cost (time, complexity, dependencies)?</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-2">
      This avoids common mistakes like:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>building something for a lot of users that doesn't actually matter</li>
      <li>building something extremely valuable but only for a tiny group</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-4 font-medium text-lg">
      And I add a final "S": Strategy
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      This is my personal addition. Some things look important short-term but don't move you toward your long-term strategy. Or they have strong timing constraints (e.g., partner launches or market windows).
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Adding Strategy keeps you honest and helps avoid shiny-object decisions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">So, let's summarize</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      If you only take a few things from this article, let them be these:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-none space-y-4 mb-8">

        <span class="text-muted-foreground">You can't analyze your way into certainty.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-medium">✔ Use frameworks to compare, not to predict ARR</span><br/>
        <span class="text-muted-foreground">They help with clarity, not forecasting.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="font-medium">✔ RICE (+S) is the most balanced and reliable model</span><br/>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Silence. Blank stares. Someone vaguely remembers a Slack thread. Another thinks it was in a Google Doc somewhere. A third is certain it came up during quarterly planning.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Nobody can find it. So you spend another hour re-debating something you already resolved months ago.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 font-medium">
      Sound familiar? This is the hidden cost of forgotten decisions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Numbers Are Staggering</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Let's put some data behind what we intuitively know:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>71%</strong> of senior managers say meetings are unproductive and inefficient (Harvard Business Review)</li>
      <li>Organizations lose <strong>$37 billion annually</strong> in the US alone due to unproductive meetings (Doodle)</li>
      <li>The average employee spends <strong>31 hours per month</strong> in meetings — and 50% of that time is considered wasted</li>
      <li>Poor operational decision-making costs companies upward of <strong>3% of profits</strong> (Gartner)</li>
      <li>Companies lose an average of <strong>$15 million per year</strong> due to decisions made on poor quality or missing information (Gartner)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Now think about how much of that waste comes from re-discussing decisions that were already made but nobody can find.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Problem Isn't Making Decisions</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Here's the thing — product teams are generally good at making decisions. We debate, we weigh tradeoffs, we commit to a path forward.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
      The problem is what happens after.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Decisions get made in:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Slack threads that scroll into oblivion</li>
      <li>Meeting notes that nobody revisits</li>
      <li>Google Docs buried three folders deep</li>
      <li>Verbal agreements that never got written down</li>
      <li>Jira comments attached to tickets that closed months ago</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8">
      Within weeks, that well-reasoned decision becomes fog. It happened, but nobody can prove it or explain the reasoning behind it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Real Costs</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      This isn't just annoying. Forgotten decisions create compounding damage:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-4">
      <li><strong>Wasted time.</strong> If your team has just 2 "didn't we already decide this?" moments per week, at 30 minutes each, that's 52 hours per year — per team. For a company with 10 product teams, that's 520 hours annually spent re-debating settled questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Contradictory choices.</strong> Without visibility into past decisions, teams make new ones that directly conflict with old ones. "We're going mobile-first" gets forgotten, and six months later someone commits to a desktop-first approach. Now you have two workstreams pulling in opposite directions.</li>
      <li><strong>Lost context.</strong> Even when you do find an old decision, the reasoning is gone. You know what was decided, but not why. So you can't tell if the original logic still applies or if circumstances have changed enough to warrant revisiting it.</li>
      <li><strong>Slower onboarding.</strong> New team members have no way to understand why things are the way they are. Every architectural choice, every product direction — it's all tribal knowledge locked in people's heads. Studies show it takes 8-12 months for new hires to reach full productivity. Poor decision visibility extends that timeline.</li>
      <li><strong>Eroded trust.</strong> When decisions keep getting revisited, people stop believing any decision is final. Commitment weakens. "Let's just wait and see" becomes the default mode. Teams that can't commit can't ship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The Opportunity Cost</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Now flip the script. Imagine if your team could:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Instantly find any past decision and its context</li>
      <li>See when new decisions might conflict with existing ones</li>
      <li>Onboard new team members with full decision history</li>
      <li>Stop wasting hours in redundant debates</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-6">
      If reclaiming even 10% of that wasted meeting time, you're looking at:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>3+ hours per employee per month</strong> back for actual work</li>
      <li><strong>Faster shipping</strong> because decisions stick</li>
      <li><strong>Higher team morale</strong> because people feel heard and progress feels real</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">How Teams Try to Solve This</h2>

    <p class="mb-4">
      Most teams recognize the problem and give it a shot:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Notion/Confluence wikis</strong> — "Let's document everything!" Great in theory, abandoned within weeks.</li>
      <li><strong>Meeting notes</strong> — Decisions get buried in pages of discussion about lunch orders and off-topic tangents.</li>
      <li><strong>Slack channels</strong> — #decisions channels that become ghost towns.</li>
      <li><strong>ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)</strong> — Solid for big technical decisions, way too heavy for everyday product choices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8">
      These solutions share a common flaw: they require extra work at the exact moment when everyone just wants to move on and start building.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">What Would Better Look Like?</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      Imagine if every decision your team made was:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
      <li>Captured at the moment it happens, without friction</li>
      <li>Searchable by topic, project, or timeframe</li>
      <li>Visible to anyone who needs context</li>
      <li>Connected to the discussion that led to it</li>
      <li>Flagged when a new decision might contradict an old one</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8">
      This isn't about bureaucracy or documentation theater. It's about turning your past decisions into an asset instead of a liability.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">I'm Building Something</h2>

    <p class="mb-6">
      I'll be honest with you — this problem has been bugging me for a while. I've lived it across multiple teams and companies. The "didn't we already decide this?" moment one too many times.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
      So I'm working on a solution. It's still early, but the goal is simple: make decision tracking effortless and actually useful.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Before I Go Too Far Down the Rabbit Hole, I Need Your Help</h2>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">

      <li>What have you tried that didn't stick?</li>
      <li>What's the most painful part of this problem for you?</li>
      <li>How much time do you estimate your team wastes on re-discussing past decisions?</li>
    </ul>
